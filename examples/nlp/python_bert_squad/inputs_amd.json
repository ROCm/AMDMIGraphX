It brings a philosophy of choice, minimalism and modular software development to GPU computing. You are free to choose or even develop tools and a language run time for your application. ROCm is built for scale, it supports multi-GPU computing and has a rich system run time with the critical features that large-scale application, compiler and language-run-time development requires. Since the ROCm ecosystem is comprised of open technologies: frameworks (Tensorflow / PyTorch), libraries (MIOpen / Blas / RCCL), programming model (HIP), inter-connect (OCD) and up streamed Linux® Kernel support – the platform is continually optimized for performance and extensibility.",
