# Performing Inference using MIGraphX Python Library

## Description
This example uses a pre-trained Resnet50 V2 model to demonstrate how inference can be run in Python using the MIGraphX library. 

## How to Use this Example
If you do not already have Jupyter Notebooks installed, please refer to this [page](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions. 

Once Jupyter Notebooks is installed, you can navigate to this directory and issue the command:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

From the browser window that is launched, click on `resnet50_inference.ipynb`
You should now be able to run the notebook from your browser.
