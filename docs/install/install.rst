Building and Installing MIGraphX
********************************************************************

Installing MIGraphX using `the package installer <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/AMDMIGraphX/en/latest/install/installing_with_package.html>`_ is sufficient for most MIGraphX users. 

Users who want to use pre-release features or want to contribute to the MIGRaphX project can build MIGraphX from its source code. 

There are three ways of building and installing MIGraphX from source code:

1. `Using CMake <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/AMDMIGraphX/en/latest/install/build_and_install_with_cmake.html>`_
2. `Using rbuild <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/AMDMIGraphX/en/latest/install/build_and_install_with_rbuild.html>`_
3. `Using Docker <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/AMDMIGraphX/en/latest/install/build_and_install_with_docker.html>`_
