# This Check_Stamped script is triggered by the Github workflows when a pull request is created.
# It works by generating a list of files that have been modified/created between the current up-to-date Develop Branch
# from MIGraphx and the Pull Request Branch via GIT DIFF. The script then checks that each file has the current year
# in the license stamp, with the assumption being that any modifications/creations will need to be stamped to the year that the
# modification/creation was made.
