===========================
MIGraphX documentation
===========================

MIGraphX is a graph inference engine and graph compiler. MIGraphX accelerates machine-learning models by leveraging several graph-level transformations and optimizations. These optimizations include:

* Operator fusion
* Arithmetic simplifications
* Dead-code elimination
* Common subexpression elimination (CSE)
* Constant propagation

After optimization, MIGraphX generates code for AMD GPUs by calling various ROCm libraries to create the fastest combinations of HIP kernels.

The MIGraphX public repository is located at `https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/ <https://github.com/ROCm/AMDMIGraphX/>`_
